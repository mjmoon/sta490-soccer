# Soccer data file preparation

This repository contains the data file prepared for
_STA490: Statistical Consultation, Communication, and Collaboration_
at the University of Toronto. The original data set was prepared by
Silberzahn et al. (2018). We selected a subset of data variables and removed
records with missing values. `prepdata.R` is the script and `soccer.log`
is the log file containing the details of the data preparation steps.
